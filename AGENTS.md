## Rhizo Multi-Agent Coordination Guide

This repository utilizes **Rhizo** for inter-assistant communication, distributed locking, and synchronized task queues over Redis/Valkey.

### 0. Self-Bootstrapping Prerequisite
All multi-agent coordination requires `rhizo` and `rift`:
```bash
npm install -g @axiomantic/rhizo rift-snapshot
```
*(In restricted environments: prefix with `npx -y @axiomantic/rhizo` or `npx -y rift-snapshot`).*

### 1. Invariants & Identity
<INVARIANT>
Identity Allocation: Agent identity must be unique and collision-free. Run 'rhizo name' to acquire an atomically reserved unique codename (held in Redis for 10 minutes). Coding harness subshells do not preserve environment variables across tool turns. Record the literal name output from 'rhizo name' (e.g. 'rhizo-sequoia') in your reasoning context and pass it explicitly in all subsequent commands: 'rhizo open <name>', 'rhizo listen <name>'.
</INVARIANT>

<FORBIDDEN>
Zero Dirty Commits: Never stage or commit coordination metadata (*.lock, .rhizo.*) into Git. Keep all agent state in ~/.gitignore_global.
</FORBIDDEN>

### 2. Listener Discipline & Anti-Token-Thrash
<CRITICAL>
Always run 'rhizo listen <agent>' with zero timeout (infinite wait). Bounded timeouts cause empty LLM turn wakeups that exhaust token budgets. Never execute 'rhizo listen &' or redirect output ('> /dev/null').
</CRITICAL>

<INVARIANT>
No Double-Daemons: Inside background subagents, 'rhizo listen' must run as a synchronous blocking foreground command that exits on message receipt. Never spawn background daemons inside subagents.
</INVARIANT>

<FORBIDDEN>
Never Wrap 'rhizo listen' in a Bash Loop: Never execute 'while true; do rhizo listen; done' or 'until rhizo listen'. Coding harnesses and parent agents only receive output and wake up when the tool execution TERMINATES. An infinite loop inside a single command prevents the process from returning, trapping the message payload inside an unmonitored subshell log and hanging the parent task forever. Each 'rhizo listen' must be a single-shot execution that exits on delivery; re-arming is the orchestrator's job in a separate task or subsequent turn.
</FORBIDDEN>

### 3. Task Claiming & Fencing
<INVARIANT>
Always negotiate leases when claiming tasks: 'rhizo claim <queue> --lease <sec>'. Acquire fencing tokens before modifying shared resources: 'rhizo lock <resource> --fencing'. Acknowledge completion with 'rhizo ack' only after verification.
</INVARIANT>

### 4. Task Routing & Optional System 1
<INVARIANT>
System 1 Routing is strictly optional. All core primitives (messaging, locking, explicit queues 'rhizo enqueue <queue>') require zero ML models and zero configuration files. Semantic routing ('rhizo enqueue --route <text>') is an optional triage accelerator; it resolves cascading rules starting from a machine-wide global configuration (~/.config/rhizo/rhizo-routes.yaml or routes.yaml, created via 'rhizo route init --global') down through repo-root and subdirectory rhizo-routes.yaml files (scaffold via 'rhizo route init'). All projects inherit global rules unless overridden.
</INVARIANT>

### 5. Case-Insensitive Coordination
<INVARIANT>
Case-Insensitive Channels & Entities: Agent codenames, inbox addresses, multicast tags ('@tag'), work queues ('queue:<name>'), distributed locks ('lock:<name>'), pub/sub channels ('channel:<name>'), tasks, and run cancellations are normalized case-insensitively. Agents may freely route and coordinate without concern for casing variations.
</INVARIANT>

## Vine Workspace & Strand Coordination Guide

Vine manages isolated copy-on-write workspaces (**Strands**), polyglot build cache normalizers, and the Two-Key integration gate for parallel agent development.

### 0. Self-Bootstrapping Prerequisite
```bash
npm install -g @axiomantic/vine rift-snapshot
```
*(In restricted environments: prefix with `npx -y @axiomantic/vine` or `npx -y rift-snapshot`).*

### 1. Invariants & Workspace Virtualization
<CRITICAL>
The Two-Key Gate: Never weave a strand into canonical trunk without passing 'vine gate' (exit code 0). Key 1 verifies in-memory mechanical mergeability; Key 2 executes the live compiler and test suite. Text mergeability does not imply compilation correctness.
</CRITICAL>

<INVARIANT>
Workspace Virtualization: Rift is the primary, preferred workspace engine ('vine new <task_id>'). Git worktree is supported as a fallback when '--worktree' is explicitly specified or if Rift is unavailable. Workspaces are strictly 1:1 with tasks; never assign multiple concurrent workers to the same strand directory.
</INVARIANT>

<FORBIDDEN>
Never stage or commit '.vine.json' or workspace metadata into Git.
</FORBIDDEN>

### 2. Weaving Protocol
Once Key 1 and Key 2 pass 100% green:
```bash
vine weave
```

## Garden Multi-Agent Swarm & Ceremony Guide

Garden directs high-level methodology, persona deliberations, and synchronized task execution on top of Rhizo (transport) and Vine (workspace integrator).

### 0. Self-Bootstrapping Prerequisite
This project requires `rhizo`, `vine`, and `garden`. If missing, install via npm:
```bash
npm install -g @axiomantic/rhizo @axiomantic/vine @axiomantic/garden rift-snapshot
```

### 1. Invariants & Epistemic Protocol
* **Zero Theatrical Dialogue**:
  Every dialectical exchange must cite empirical evidence obtained from tool execution (file line citations, test suite runs, AST analysis, compiler output). Theatrical roleplay without tool grounding is strictly prohibited.
* **Single-Source Planning**:
  All tasks, locks, and strands must be coordinated via `implementation_plan.md`. Dynamic progress must be tracked in lockstep with plan checkboxes (`- [ ]` to `- [x]`) and harness To-Do tracking.
* **Emergent Design Addendum Protocol**:
  Workers discovering architectural discrepancies cannot unilaterally deviate from `design.md`. They must submit a formal `addendum_<topic>.md` with rationale, await Orchestrator ratification, update `design.md`, and refresh `implementation_plan.md`.

### 2. Fleet Lifecycle & Session Coordination
* **Prompt-Bootstrapped Sessions**:
  Swarm workers operate in dedicated interactive coding sessions (Claude Code, OpenCode, Antigravity, Pi, etc.) bootstrapped from Garden prompt cards (`garden prompts` / `garden launch`). Never detach unmanaged background processes with `&` or redirect output.
* **Listener Discipline**:
  Workers arm their single-shot Rhizo listener (`rhizo listen <agent>`) with zero-timeout infinite wait to prevent token thrashing. Never wrap `rhizo listen` in a shell while-loop.

### 3. The Two-Key Gate & Strand Weaving
Never weave a strand into the canonical trunk without passing both keys:
* **Key 1 (Mechanical)**: In-memory conflict pre-check (`git merge-tree --write-tree`).
* **Key 2 (Semantic)**: Automated compiler and test suite run inside the strand.
* **Weave**: `vine weave && rhizo ack queue:<project>:tasks <task_id>`
